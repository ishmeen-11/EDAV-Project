This project examines how rising temperatures are harming people’s health and impacting healthcare systems. The objective is to understand if rising heat is leading to more hospitalizations and deaths, which age groups are getting hit hardest, and which parts of the country face the biggest risks.\nThe main questions we’re exploring are:\n\nHow have extreme heat events changed across U.S. regions from 2000 to 2023?\nIs there a relationship between more heat events and health outcomes like hospitalizations, emergency visits, and deaths?\nWhich age groups and demographic groups are most at risk?",

We draw on four datasets focusing on heat-related health impacts spanning 2000-2022:\nAll health outcome datasets (Tables 2-3) include breakdowns by age group and sex. The data is updated annually by the CDC. Key limitations include incomplete state participation in health outcomes reporting and differences in geographic resolution, with heat events tracked at the county level while health outcomes are only available at the state level. Additionally, the mortality dataset has substantial data suppression where values are not reported when annual deaths fall below 10 for privacy protection.\nSee ReadME to understand how the dataset has been downloaded from the source.\nCode\n#install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"lubridate\", \"sf\", \"maps\", \"choroplethr\", \"choroplethrMaps\", \"treemap\"))\nlibrary(classInt)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.13.0, GDAL 3.8.5, PROJ 9.5.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(maps)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'maps'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    map\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(choroplethr)\nlibrary(choroplethrMaps)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(patchwork) \nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)",

This happens because the reported annual death counts fall below 10 and it’s a privacy protection measure to prevent identifying individuals in small communities. While this policy makes sense for privacy, it creates a real problem for our analysis. The suppression hits hardest in smaller states and rural counties with lower populations - ironically, these might be exactly the places where heat-related deaths are most unpredictable and where prevention programs could make the biggest difference. By removing this data, we’re essentially limited to studying larger, more populous areas.\n\n\nCode\n# Splitting Age Group\"Sex into 2 separate columns for Hospitalization dataset \nhosp$Age_Group &lt;- str_extract(hosp$Age.Group.Sex, '^[^\"]+')\nhosp$Sex &lt;- str_extract(hosp$Age.Group.Sex, '[^\"]+$')\n# Remove original column\nhosp$Age.Group.Sex &lt;- NULL\n\n\nThe original CDC data combines age group and sex into a single column (e.g., “0-4 years”Male”). By splitting this into separate variables, we enable more flexible analysis and we can now examine age patterns independent of sex, sex differences within age groups, or their interaction effects.\n\n\nCode\n# Splitting Age Group\"Sex into 2 sepeare columns for Emergency Visits dataset\ner_visits$Age_Group &lt;- str_extract(er_visits$Age.Group.Sex, '^[^\"]+')\ner_visits$Sex &lt;- str_extract(er_visits$Age.Group.Sex, '[^\"]+$')\n# Remove original column\ner_visits$Age.Group.Sex &lt;- NULL\nsuppressWarnings({\n  er_visits &lt;- er_visits |&gt; mutate(ER.Visits = as.numeric(as.character(ER.Visits)))\n})\n\n\nWe apply the same age/sex splitting transformation to the ER visits dataset for consistency. The numeric conversion is critical because some values may have been stored as factors or characters. Any NAs created during conversion indicate non-numeric values in the original data (e.g., suppressed values or data quality issues). The ER visits dataset provides a less severe measure of heat-related health impacts compared to hospitalizations or deaths - examining all three outcomes together will reveal the spectrum of heat-related morbidity.\n\n\nCode\nmerged_all &lt;- \n  deaths |&gt; \n    mutate(.dataset = \"deaths\") |&gt;\n  bind_rows(hosp |&gt; mutate(.dataset = \"hosp\")) |&gt;\n  bind_rows(er_visits |&gt; mutate(.dataset = \"er_visits\")) |&gt;\n  bind_rows(heat_events |&gt; mutate(.dataset = \"heat_events\"))\n\nredav::plot_missing(merged_all)\n\n\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis aggregated missing pattern visualization reveals critical data quality issues across all four datasets.\nThe plot shows that the deaths dataset has the highest proportion of missing values due to CDC suppression policies. Missing values are NOT randomly distributed and that they likely correlate with smaller populations and lower event frequencies. The heat_events dataset appears most complete, providing reliable environmental exposure data. State participation varies across health outcomes, with some states reporting to some systems but not others.\nThis pattern of missingness is systematically related to the underlying values (small death counts are suppressed). This means we cannot simply impute missing values without introducing bias. Our analysis strategy must account for this structural missingness.\n\n\nCode\n# Geospatial graph for heat events\nheat_by_state &lt;- heat_events |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(value = sum(EHE))\nheat_by_state$region &lt;- tolower(heat_by_state$State)\nstate_choropleth(heat_by_state,\n                 title = \"Heat Events by State\",\n                 legend = \"Total Events\",\n                 num_colors = 7) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlOrRd\")\n\n\ngeoid_type = 'auto'; the geoid region was determined to be of type: name.lower.

Clear spatial patterns emerge:\nSouthern and Southwestern states (Texas, Arizona, Florida) show the highest heat event totals Northern states show lower frequencies, though this may reflect both climate differences and shorter time series Coastal states show varied patterns - Gulf Coast states have high exposure while Pacific Northwest states have lower exposure The quantile-based color breaks create 7 categories, ensuring each category contains roughly equal numbers of states\nThis baseline visualization helps us understand the environmental exposure landscape before we filter to states with complete health outcome data.\n\n\nCode\n# Get common states \nstates_deaths &lt;- unique(deaths$State)\nstates_hosp &lt;- unique(hosp$State)\nstates_ed &lt;- unique(er_visits$State)\nstates_heat &lt;- unique(heat_events$State)\ncommon_states &lt;- Reduce(intersect, list(states_deaths, states_hosp, states_ed, states_heat))\nprint(common_states)\n\n\n [1] \"Arizona\"        \"California\"     \"Colorado\"       \"Connecticut\"   \n [5] \"Florida\"        \"Indiana\"        \"Iowa\"           \"Kansas\"        \n [9] \"Kentucky\"       \"Louisiana\"      \"Maine\"          \"Maryland\"      \n[13] \"Massachusetts\"  \"Michigan\"       \"Minnesota\"      \"Missouri\"      \n[17] \"Nebraska\"       \"New Hampshire\"  \"New Jersey\"     \"New Mexico\"    \n[21] \"New York\"       \"North Carolina\" \"Oregon\"         \"Pennsylvania\"  \n[25] \"Rhode Island\"   \"South Carolina\" \"Tennessee\"      \"Utah\"          \n[29] \"Vermont\"        \"Virginia\"       \"Wisconsin\"     \n\n\nCode\nlength(common_states)\n\n\n[1] 31\n\n\nCode\n# Filter each dataset to keep only common states\ndeaths &lt;- deaths |&gt;\n  filter(State %in% common_states)\nhosp &lt;- hosp|&gt;\n  filter(State %in% common_states)\ner_visits &lt;- er_visits|&gt;\n  filter(State %in% common_states)\nheat_events &lt;- heat_events|&gt;\n  filter(State %in% common_states)\n\n\nThis filtering step is crucial for creating a consistent analytical dataset. We retain only the 31 states that report data across ALL four datasets, which dramatically reduces our sample size but ensures we can examine relationships between heat exposure and health outcomes. Important considerations:\nWe lose 20 states (39% of states), raising concerns about generalizability The retained states likely represent larger, better-resourced public health systems Rural and smaller states are disproportionately excluded This filtered dataset provides internal validity (we can compare heat events to health outcomes within the same states) but limits external validity (findings may not generalize to excluded states)\n\n\nCode\n# Filter all datasets to include only data through 2022\ndeaths &lt;- deaths |&gt;\n  filter(Year &lt;= 2022)\n\nhosp &lt;- hosp |&gt;\n  filter(Year &lt;= 2022)\n\ner_visits &lt;- er_visits |&gt;\n  filter(Year &lt;= 2022)\n\nheat_events &lt;- heat_events |&gt;\n  filter(Year &lt;= 2022)\n\n\nHere, we are filtering the data to only include till the year 2022 so that all the 4 datasets match in terms of the years.\n\n\nCode\nheat_by_state &lt;- heat_events |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(value = sum(EHE))\n\nheat_by_state$region &lt;- tolower(heat_by_state$State)\n\n# Calculate Jenks breaks\njenks_breaks &lt;- classIntervals(heat_by_state$value, n = 5, style = \"jenks\")\njenks_breaks\n\n\nstyle: jenks\n  one of 27,405 possible partitions of this variable into 5 classes\n     [23,11566]   (11566,41204]   (41204,71261]  (71261,108015] (108015,161834] \n             14               6               7               3               1 \n\n\nCode\n# Use the breaks in choroplethr\nstate_choropleth(heat_by_state,\n                 title = \"Heat Events by State (Jenks Breaks)\",\n                 legend = \"Total Events\",\n                 num_colors = 1) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, \"YlOrRd\"),\n                       breaks = jenks_breaks$brks,\n                       labels = round(jenks_breaks$brks))\n\n\ngeoid_type = 'auto'; the geoid region was determined to be of type: name.lower.

Comparing the maps reveals that our 31 retained states still span the full range of heat exposure—from low-burden northeastern states to extreme high-burden southern and plains states like Kansas and Missouri. While we lose geographic coverage, particularly smaller and mid-sized states, the retained states preserve the variation in heat exposure levels necessary for meaningful analysis. The missing 20 states appear to be spread across exposure categories rather than concentrated in one category, suggesting our filtered dataset isn’t systematically biased toward high or low heat states.\n\n\nCode\ndeaths &lt;- deaths |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Deaths))\nhosp &lt;- hosp |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Hosps))\ner_visits &lt;- er_visits |&gt;\n  mutate(ER.Visits = as.numeric(as.character(ER.Visits)))\ner_visits &lt;- er_visits |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(ER.Visits))\nheat_events &lt;- heat_events |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(EHE))\n\n\nThis final cleaning step removes all rows with missing outcome values, creating a complete-case dataset for analysis.

    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nBetween 2000 and 2023, the CDC tracked over 74,000 extreme heat events across the United States—periods where temperatures exceeded 90°F for two or more consecutive days. These events translate directly into public health impacts: emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and deaths.\nWe’re working with four datasets from the CDC’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Network covering extreme heat events, hospitalizations, ER visits, and deaths. While data exists for more states, we filtered down to 31 states that have complete reporting across all four datasets. This gives us a consistent picture of how heat exposure connects to health outcomes, though it does mean we’re missing data from 20 states.\nWhat we found is pretty clear: heat-related health problems aren’t just increasing but that they’re getting worse faster.\nCode\n# Load cleaned data\nheat_events &lt;- read.csv(\"data_clean/heat_events_clean.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\nhosp &lt;- read.csv(\"data_clean/hosp_clean.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\ner_visits &lt;- read.csv(\"data_clean/er_visits_clean.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\ndeaths &lt;- read.csv(\"data_clean/deaths_clean.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)",

    "text": "3.2 Growing Crisis\n\n3.2.1 All Three Health Outcomes Are Surging\nFirst, let’s look at how these health impacts have changed over the past two decades. Since we’re comparing three very different metrics (ER visits happen way more often than deaths), we used indexing to put them on the same scale. For each outcome, we divided every year’s value by the year 2000 value and multiplied by 100. This means year 2000 equals 100% for all three lines, and we can see the relative rate of change for each outcome.\n\n\nCode\n# Combined health outcomes over time\noutcomes_time &lt;- bind_rows(\n  hosp |&gt; \n    group_by(Year) |&gt; \n    summarise(value = sum(Hosps, na.rm = TRUE), \n              outcome = \"Hospitalizations\"),\n  er_visits |&gt; \n    group_by(Year) |&gt; \n    summarise(value = sum(ER.Visits, na.rm = TRUE), \n              outcome = \"ER Visits\"),\n  deaths |&gt; \n    group_by(Year) |&gt; \n    summarise(value = sum(as.numeric(Deaths), na.rm = TRUE), \n              outcome = \"Deaths\")\n)\n\n# Calculate percentage of 2000 baseline for each outcome\noutcomes_indexed &lt;- outcomes_time |&gt;\n  group_by(outcome) |&gt;\n  mutate(baseline = value[Year == min(Year)],\n         index = (value / baseline) * 100) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(outcomes_indexed, aes(x = Year, y = index, color = outcome)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 100, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.3, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Hospitalizations\" = \"#e31a1c\", \n               \"ER Visits\" = \"#fd8d3c\", \n               \"Deaths\" = \"#800026\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"%\"),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0.05, 0.1))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2022, by = 4)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Heat-Related Health Impacts Have Surged Since 2000\",\n    subtitle = \"All three outcomes indexed to baseline year (2000 = 100%)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Index (2000 = 100%)\",\n    color = NULL,\n    caption = \"Note: Data covers 31 states with complete reporting across all datasets\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = \"gray30\", hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.justification = \"left\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray50\", hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 10))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three outcomes have increased significantly since 2000, with ER visits roughly doubling and hospitalizations increasing substantially. ER visits show the most dramatic growth, spiking to over 700% of baseline in 2019, while hospitalizations have roughly doubled. The most striking pattern is in recent years, both ER visits and deaths surge to unprecedented levels between 2019 and 2022, suggesting the problem is accelerating rather than stabilizing.\nHowever, the dramatic spikes we see in 2019-2022—particularly ER visits reaching over 700% of baseline—raise an important question: could COVID-19 be influencing these patterns? The pandemic could affect heat-related health data in several ways: healthcare system strain making heat impacts more severe, changes in reporting practices, people staying home more without adequate cooling, or even coding complications where some cases were misattributed. This temporal overlap means we need to be cautious about interpreting the most recent years’ trends as solely climate-driven.\n\n\n3.2.2 Heat Exposure and Health Impacts Move Together\nThe surge in health outcomes suggests increased heat exposure, but we need to verify this connection directly. To compare heat events with hospitalizations (two metrics with completely different scales), we standardized both by converting them to z-scores. This shows how many standard deviations each year is from its average: when both lines spike at the same time, it confirms they’re moving in sync.\n\n\nCode\n# Create combined dataset with annual aggregates\ncombined &lt;- heat_events |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(heat_events = sum(EHE, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    hosp |&gt;\n      group_by(Year) |&gt;\n      summarise(hospitalizations = sum(Hosps, na.rm = TRUE)),\n    by = \"Year\"\n  )\n\ncombined_standardized &lt;- combined |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    heat_z = scale(heat_events)[,1],\n    hosp_z = scale(hospitalizations)[,1]\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(heat_z, hosp_z),\n               names_to = \"Metric\",\n               values_to = \"Standardized_Value\")\n\nggplot(combined_standardized, aes(x = Year, y = Standardized_Value, color = Metric)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\") +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"heat_z\" = \"firebrick\", \"hosp_z\" = \"royalblue\"),\n    labels = c(\"Heat Events\", \"Hospitalizations\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Trends in Heat Events and Hospitalizations\",\n    subtitle = \"Standardized values show synchronized spikes in extreme heat and hospitalizations\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Standard Deviations from Mean\",\n    color = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, color = \"gray30\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two lines generally move together, with both showing an upward trend and co-occurring peaks in years like 2011. However, the relationship isn’t perfectly synchronized. In 2018, for example, hospitalizations peaked while heat events remained near average, suggesting that factors beyond just heat exposure matter. This could reflect changes in population vulnerability, healthcare access, or reporting practices. The imperfect correlation points to an important reality: while heat exposure is a key driver of health impacts, local preparedness, demographics, and infrastructure also play crucial roles.\n\n\n3.2.3 The Problem Is Accelerating\nWe’ve seen that both heat exposure and health impacts are increasing, but the question is: at what rate? To understand if the problem is getting worse faster, we broke the data into two equal time periods and calculated the percentage increase from one period to the next.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate period averages for two equal periods\nperiod_summary &lt;- combined |&gt;\n  mutate(period = case_when(\n    Year &lt;= 2011 ~ \"2000-2011\",\n    TRUE ~ \"2012-2022\"\n  )) |&gt;\n  group_by(period) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_heat = mean(heat_events),\n    avg_hosp = mean(hospitalizations)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    heat_pct_change = (avg_heat / lag(avg_heat) - 1) * 100,\n    hosp_pct_change = (avg_hosp / lag(avg_hosp) - 1) * 100\n  )\n\n# Reshape for plotting - only second period (which has the % changes)\nperiod_long &lt;- period_summary |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(heat_pct_change)) |&gt;  # Only keep row with calculated changes\n  select(period, heat_pct_change, hosp_pct_change) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(heat_pct_change, hosp_pct_change),\n               names_to = \"metric\",\n               values_to = \"pct_change\") |&gt;\n  mutate(metric = factor(metric, \n                        levels = c(\"heat_pct_change\", \"hosp_pct_change\"),\n                        labels = c(\"Heat Events\", \"Hospitalizations\")))\n\nggplot(period_long, aes(x = metric, y = pct_change, fill = metric)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.6, alpha = 0.9) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"+%.0f%%\", pct_change)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 5, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Heat Events\" = \"#d73027\", \"Hospitalizations\" = \"#4575b4\"),\n                    guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"%\"), \n                     limits = c(0, max(period_long$pct_change) * 1.15),\n                     expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Health Impacts Are Growing Faster Than Heat Exposure\",\n    subtitle = \"Change from 2000-2011 to 2012-2022 shows disproportionate increase in hospitalizations\",\n    x = NULL, \n    y = \"% Increase\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0, color = \"gray30\", margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile both heat events and hospitalizations increased from the first period (2000-2011) to the second (2012-2022), the rates tell an important story about vulnerability. Heat events increased by 16%, but hospitalizations surged by 32%, double the rate of heat exposure growth. This gap suggests that the same amount of heat is causing more health impacts than it used to. Potential explanations include an aging population, increased urbanization and heat island effects, declining access to air conditioning or cooling centers, or changing outdoor work patterns. Whatever the cause, people are becoming more vulnerable to heat, not less, despite increased awareness of the risks.",

The most striking thing is 2011, when you can see the entire top half of the chart turn dark red. That was a really bad year for heat across multiple states at once.\nWhat’s interesting is that it’s not just getting steadily worse over time. Instead, there’s a lot of year-to-year variation, with certain extreme years like 2011 and 2012 hitting multiple states hard at the same time. This suggests that big weather events like droughts affect entire regions together rather than individual states in isolation.\nKansas, Missouri, and Louisiana are consistently the worst hit states. California and Florida actually show lower heat event counts, which is kind of surprising since we think of them as hot places. This could be because of differences in humidity, how heat is distributed throughout the year, or just geographic differences in what counts as an “extreme” heat event.\n\n\n3.3.2 Does More Heat Exposure Lead to More Hospitalizations?\nWe’ve seen that both heat events and hospitalizations are increasing nationally, and we know which states have the most heat. But does high heat exposure actually translate directly into high hospitalization rates? To answer this, we plotted total heat events against total hospitalizations for each state and identified outliers that deviate from the expected pattern.\n\n\nCode\n# State-level aggregates\nscatter_data &lt;- heat_events |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(heat_events = sum(EHE)) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    hosp |&gt;\n      group_by(State) |&gt;\n      summarise(hospitalizations = sum(Hosps)),\n    by = \"State\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(hospitalizations))\n\n# Calculate correlation\ncor_value &lt;- cor(scatter_data$heat_events, scatter_data$hospitalizations)\n\n# Fit linear model and identify outliers\nlm_model &lt;- lm(hospitalizations ~ heat_events, data = scatter_data)\nscatter_data &lt;- scatter_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    predicted = predict(lm_model),\n    residual = hospitalizations - predicted,\n    is_outlier = abs(residual) &gt; 1.5 * sd(residual)\n  )\n\nggplot(scatter_data, aes(x = heat_events, y = hospitalizations)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"#d73027\", \n              fill = \"#d73027\", alpha = 0.2, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = is_outlier), size = 4, alpha = 0.7) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    data = scatter_data |&gt; filter(is_outlier),\n    aes(label = State),\n    size = 3.5,\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    box.padding = 0.5,\n    point.padding = 0.3,\n    segment.color = \"gray50\",\n    max.overlaps = 15\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"#4575b4\", \"TRUE\" = \"#e31a1c\"), \n                     guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Higher Heat Exposure Predicts More Hospitalizations—But Not Always\",\n    subtitle = sprintf(\"Correlation: r = %.2f | Outlier states labeled (red)\", cor_value),\n    x = \"Total Heat Events (2000-2022)\",\n    y = \"Total Hospitalizations (2000-2022)\",\n    caption = \"Outliers suggest some states handle heat better—or have vulnerable populations\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0, color = \"gray30\", margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray50\", hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 10))\n  )\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a positive relationship (r = 0.29), but it’s weaker than expected, with significant scatter. The three outliers—Florida, California, and Arizona—all show high hospitalizations relative to heat exposure. However, we need to be cautious about interpreting this graph: these three outliers are also among the most populous states in our dataset. Florida has about 22 million people, California has 39 million, and Arizona has 7 million, while states like Kansas have only 3 million.\nThis means we can’t distinguish whether these states are outliers because they’re worse at handling heat or simply because they have more people. A state with 10 times the population will naturally have more hospitalizations even if their per capita rate is identical. The weak overall correlation (r = 0.29) confirms that raw counts don’t tell us much about state-level preparedness or vulnerability.\nThis is exactly why we need the standardized comparison in the next section—by converting to z-scores, we can compare states on an equal footing regardless of population size.\n\n\n3.3.3 State-Level Comparisons: Who’s Managing Heat Better?\nWe’ve seen which states have the most heat events, but raw counts don’t tell us which states are handling heat effectively. By standardizing both heat events and hospitalizations (converting to z-scores), we can compare states on a level playing field regardless of their size or population.\n\n\nCode\n#| fig-height: 14\n\n# Create state-level summaries\nheat_by_state &lt;- heat_events |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(heat_events = sum(EHE, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nhosp_by_state &lt;- hosp |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(hospitalizations = sum(Hosps, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Create the order FIRST\nstate_order &lt;- heat_by_state |&gt;\n  arrange(heat_events) |&gt;\n  pull(State)\n\n# Now create scaled data\ncleveland_data_scaled &lt;- heat_by_state |&gt;\n  left_join(hosp_by_state, by = \"State\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    heat_scaled = scale(heat_events)[,1],\n    hosp_scaled = scale(hospitalizations)[,1]\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(heat_scaled, hosp_scaled),\n               names_to = \"Metric\",\n               values_to = \"Standardized_Count\") |&gt;\n  mutate(State = factor(State, levels = state_order))\n\n# Plot\nggplot(cleveland_data_scaled, aes(x = Standardized_Count, y = State, color = Metric)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1, 0, 1), \n             linetype = c(\"dotted\", \"dashed\", \"dotted\"), \n             color = \"gray60\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.9) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"heat_scaled\" = \"#d73027\", \"hosp_scaled\" = \"#4575b4\"),\n    labels = c(\"Heat Events\", \"Hospitalizations\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Some States Have Disproportionate Health Impacts\",\n    subtitle = \"Standardized comparison reveals efficiency gaps in heat preparedness\",\n    x = \"Standard Deviations from National Mean\",\n    y = NULL,\n    color = NULL,\n    caption = \"States where dots are far apart show mismatch between heat exposure and health impact\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0, color = \"gray30\", margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.justification = \"left\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # Keep major gridlines, remove only minor\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray50\", hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 10))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standardized comparison reveals interesting mismatches between heat exposure and health impacts. Most states cluster around the diagonal where heat and hospitalizations track together, but several outliers stand out.\nKansas sits at an extreme, more than 3 standard deviations above average for heat events but only about 1.5 standard deviations above average for hospitalizations. This suggests Kansas may be better adapted to handle extreme heat, possibly through infrastructure, public awareness campaigns, or population demographics that are less vulnerable.\nOn the flip side, Florida shows the opposite pattern. Despite having heat exposure around the national average, Florida’s hospitalizations are significantly elevated. This disproportionate health impact could reflect Florida’s large elderly population, who are more vulnerable to heat stress, or it could indicate gaps in cooling access or heat preparedness programs. Given Florida’s climate, you’d expect residents to be more adapted to heat, but the data suggests otherwise.\nCalifornia and Arizona also show hospitalizations exceeding what their heat exposure would predict, though to a lesser degree than Florida. States in the middle and lower left (like Maine, Vermont, Connecticut) have both low heat exposure and low health impacts, as expected.\n\n\n3.3.4 Not All States Follow the Same Pattern\nWhile national trends show increasing hospitalizations, state-level trajectories vary considerably. To illustrate this diversity, we selected six representative states and tracked their hospitalization trends over time, indexing each to its year 2000 baseline.\n\n\nCode\n# Select states representing different patterns from our dataset\nselected_states &lt;- c(\"Kansas\", \"Missouri\", \"Florida\",\n                     \"California\", \"Rhode Island\", \"Maine\")\n\n# Prepare data for small multiples\nsmall_mult_data &lt;- hosp |&gt;\n  filter(State %in% selected_states) |&gt;\n  group_by(State, Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(state_hosp = sum(Hosps), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    baseline = state_hosp[Year == min(Year)],\n    hosp_indexed = (state_hosp / baseline) * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(small_mult_data, aes(x = Year, y = hosp_indexed)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 100, linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"gray50\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#4575b4\", linewidth = 1.2, alpha = 0.8) +\n  facet_wrap(~State, ncol = 3) +  # Remove scales = \"free_y\"\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"%\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2020, by = 10)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Hospitalization Trends Vary Dramatically Across States\",\n    subtitle = \"Indexed to each state's year 2000 baseline (100%)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Index (2000 = 100%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0, color = \"gray30\", margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fixed scale reveals dramatically different state trajectories and explains the patterns we saw in the Cleveland dot plot. Florida stands out with explosive growth and it explains why Florida appeared as such a stark outlier in the Cleveland comparison. The spike accelerates sharply after 2015, suggesting Florida’s heat vulnerability is a relatively recent and rapidly worsening problem.\nCalifornia and Missouri show more moderate but steady growth, roughly doubling from baseline. Both maintain consistent upward trends that explain their elevated hospitalization positions in the Cleveland plot.\nKansas presents the most interesting pattern. Despite having the highest heat exposure in our entire dataset, hospitalizations have remained essentially flat over 23 years, hovering around the baseline. This temporal stability confirms what the Cleveland plot suggested; Kansas has successfully maintained its ability to handle extreme heat over time, whether through sustained infrastructure investment, effective public health programs, or an adapted population.\nRhode Island shows high volatility with dramatic year-to-year swings but an overall upward trend, while Maine actually shows a decline, dropping below baseline in recent years. This decline explains Maine’s position in the lower left of the Cleveland plot.\nThese divergent trajectories confirm that the state-level differences we observed aren’t just snapshots but reflect sustained patterns of preparedness, vulnerability, and response capacity that have evolved over two decades.\n\n\n3.3.5 The Heat-Health Burden by State\nThe treemap provides a compelling overview of the geographic inequality of the heat-health burden, where the size of the box represents total hospitalizations and the color intensity represents total heat events.\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare data\ntreemap_data &lt;- heat_events |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(heat_events = sum(EHE)) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    hosp |&gt;\n      group_by(State) |&gt;\n      summarise(hospitalizations = sum(Hosps)),\n    by = \"State\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(hospitalizations))\n\n# Create treemap\ntreemap(treemap_data,\n        index = \"State\",\n        vSize = \"hospitalizations\",          \n        vColor = \"heat_events\",     \n        type = \"value\",\n        palette = \"YlOrRd\",\n        title = \"Heat Events and Hospitalizations by State\",\n        title.legend = \"Heat Events\",\n        fontsize.labels = 10,\n        fontcolor.labels = \"white\",\n        align.labels = c(\"center\", \"center\"),\n        bg.labels = 0,\n        border.col = \"white\",\n        border.lwds = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe states with the largest boxes (e.g., Florida, California, Arizona) are the primary drivers of absolute hospitalization numbers, regardless of their heat event count, highlighting that a small number of states carry the majority of the national burden. States with the darkest color (e.g., Kansas, Louisiana) have the highest exposure to extreme heat events.\nFlorida has one of the largest boxes (high hospitalizations) but a mid-range color intensity (mid-range heat events). This pattern confirms the insight from the previous analysis: despite having a heat exposure around the national average, Florida has significantly elevated hospitalizations. This health impact is likely due to the state’s large, vulnerable population, especially the elderly, or gaps in heat preparedness.\nKansas has a dark, intense color (high heat events) but a relatively smaller box (lower hospitalizations). This suggests a strong level of adaptation; the state faces the worst heat exposure in the dataset but successfully maintains hospitalizations near the average. The smaller health impact despite high heat confirms that Kansas has maintained its ability to handle extreme heat over two decades",

While all three health outcomes show positive correlations with heat events, the relationships are surprisingly weak: hospitalizations (0.28), ER visits (0.37), and deaths (0.10). This confirms what we’ve seen throughout our analysis—heat exposure alone is a poor predictor of health impacts. What’s more striking is the bottom-right triangle: the three health outcomes are strongly correlated with each other. Hospitalizations and ER visits show a 0.78 correlation, while hospitalizations and deaths correlate at 0.64. This suggests that once heat starts causing problems in a state, it cascades across the entire healthcare system. States experiencing more ER visits also see more hospitalizations and deaths, regardless of their absolute heat exposure levels. This pattern reinforces our key finding: the states struggling with heat aren’t necessarily the ones with the most extreme temperatures but they’re the ones where heat translates into health crises due to vulnerability factors like demographics, infrastructure, or preparedness.",

The darkest bands—representing hospitalizations—dominate the older age groups. The key finding is age is a critical risk factor. Older Americans are most vulnerable to severe heat-related illness.",

    "text": "3.6 The Ultimate Cost: State-Level Mortality from Heat\nThese two charts shift the focus to the most critical heat-related outcome—death—revealing that a handful of states drive the national mortality numbers, but the true burden across all states is likely obscured by widespread data suppression.\nIt is important to note that the interpretation of heat death statistics is limited by data suppression: approximately 52% of all mortality data is suppressed due to privacy concerns when the total number of deaths in a state falls below 10. This means the actual death burden for states with lower reported totals may be significantly higher than displayed, and the true mortality rate is likely underestimated.\n\n3.6.1 Wide Variation in Heat-Related Mortality Rates Across States\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate mortality rates\nmortality_rate &lt;- hosp |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(hospitalizations = sum(Hosps, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    deaths |&gt; \n      group_by(State) |&gt; \n      summarise(deaths = sum(as.numeric(Deaths), na.rm = TRUE)),\n    by = \"State\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(mortality_rate = (deaths / hospitalizations) * 100) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(mortality_rate), mortality_rate &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(mortality_rate)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 20) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    rate_category = case_when(\n      mortality_rate &gt;= 15 ~ \"Very High (≥15%)\",\n      mortality_rate &gt;= 10 ~ \"High (10-15%)\",\n      mortality_rate &gt;= 5 ~ \"Moderate (5-10%)\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Lower (&lt;5%)\"\n    ),\n    rate_category = factor(rate_category, \n                          levels = c(\"Very High (≥15%)\", \"High (10-15%)\", \n                                    \"Moderate (5-10%)\", \"Lower (&lt;5%)\"))\n  )\n\n# Calculate average for reference line\navg_rate &lt;- mean(mortality_rate$mortality_rate)\n\nggplot(mortality_rate, aes(x = reorder(State, mortality_rate), \n                           y = mortality_rate, fill = rate_category)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.9, width = 0.8) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = avg_rate, linetype = \"dashed\", \n             color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 10, y = avg_rate + 0.5, \n           label = sprintf(\"Average: %.1f%%\", avg_rate),\n           color = \"black\", size = 3.5, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Very High (≥15%)\" = \"#bd0026\",\n               \"High (10-15%)\" = \"#f03b20\",\n               \"Moderate (5-10%)\" = \"#fd8d3c\",\n               \"Lower (&lt;5%)\" = \"#fecc5c\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Deaths per 100 hospitalizations (Top 20 states)\",\n    x = NULL, \n    y = \"Mortality Rate (%)\",\n    fill = \"Severity Level\",\n    caption = \"Rates above 10% suggest either more severe heat events or gaps in emergency response\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0, color = \"gray30\", margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.justification = \"left\",\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray50\", hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 10))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph measures the severity of the heat problem by showing the percentage of heat-related hospitalizations that result in death (Mortality Rate).\nStates like Indiana and Arizona have exceptionally high mortality rates, with Indiana’s rate exceeding 40%. These states fall into the “Very High” (\\(\\ge 15\\%\\)) severity level, suggesting potential severe heat events or significant failures in emergency response, where patients are either presenting late or receiving inadequate care\nHigh-burden states like Florida (high hospitalizations) and Kansas (high heat events) do not appear in the top 10 for mortality rate. This suggests that while they struggle with volume or exposure, their systems are relatively more effective at preventing death once a case reaches the hospital.\nWhile the extreme rates of the top outliers (like Indiana) are unlikely to be fundamentally altered by data suppression, the rates of states at the lower end of the top 20 are potentially underestimated. The suppressed data means the true mortality rate for many states may be higher than reported.\n\n\n3.6.2 Absolute Heat Death Burden is Concentrated in a Few States\nThis graph shows which states are the main drivers of the absolute number of heat-related deaths by measuring the difference from the national average.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate deviations from mean\ndeath_diverge &lt;- deaths |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(deaths = sum(as.numeric(Deaths), na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    mean_deaths = mean(deaths),\n    diff = deaths - mean_deaths,\n    pct_diff = (diff / mean_deaths) * 100,\n    type = ifelse(diff &gt; 0, \"Above Average\", \"Below Average\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(diff) |&gt;\n  mutate(State = factor(State, levels = State))\n\nggplot(death_diverge, aes(x = State, y = diff, fill = type)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.9, width = 0.8) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  geom_text(data = death_diverge |&gt; filter(abs(diff) &gt; 150),\n            aes(label = sprintf(\"%+.0f\", diff),\n                y = diff + ifelse(diff &gt; 0, 20, -20)),\n            size = 3.5, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Above Average\" = \"#bd0026\", \n                               \"Below Average\" = \"#4575b4\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) sprintf(\"%+.0f\", x)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most States Fall Below National Average for Heat Deaths\",\n    subtitle = \"A handful of high-mortality states drive the national numbers\",\n    x = NULL, \n    y = \"Difference from National Average (deaths)\",\n    fill = NULL,\n    caption = \"Positive values indicate states exceeding average; negative indicates below average\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0, margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0, color = \"gray30\", margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.justification = \"left\",\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = \"gray50\", hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 10))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stark handful of states, particularly Arizona (nearly \\(+3,000\\) deaths above average) and California (over \\(+1,300\\) deaths above average), account for a massively disproportionate share of the national heat death count. This confirms that the fatal outcome of the heat crisis is concentrated geographically in these extreme outlier states.\nThe vast majority of states fall below the national average. This pattern is heavily influenced by the skew of the top outliers. However, the presence of the 52% data suppression means the total number of heat deaths in these “below-average” states is likely undercounted, suggesting the overall national heat death crisis is worse than the public record indicates, even if the geographic concentration remains clear.\nFlorida’s position, moderately above the average (by \\(+205\\) deaths) but far below the leading states, reinforces the finding that its core problem is a high volume of non-fatal illness (morbidity), rather than extreme fatality per case.",
